# Build a Markdown Previewer

## Objective:
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://markdown-previewer.freecodecamp.rocks/.


## Acknowledge:
I follow the [guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-markdown-previewer-with-react-js/) to build the markdown previewer with React .
Therefore, this commit is to record how to write Front End Development with React, and the formal solution is [here](https://github.com/voldemort92205/freeCodeCamp-practice/tree/main/ch3-Front_End_Development_Libraries/Build_a_Markdown_Previewer).
